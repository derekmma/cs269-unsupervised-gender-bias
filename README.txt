The file src/run_saved_models.sh contains code for loading the pre-trained models used in the paper and running them over test data. This script requires separately downloading the models and training data (for vocabulary construction), available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvVTk-FIW__oEl3Nz2ruifhpfIQ_JCsO/view?usp=sharing (Note that these files are large, 7.7G compresssed).

In addition to the packages listed in requirements.txt, this repository also uses "en-core-web-sm==2.2.0", which can be downloaded with "python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm"
